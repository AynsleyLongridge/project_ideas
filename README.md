## Idea 1 - An app that tells you how busy bars are

## Overview

Looking for a quiet drink only to find there is a deadly que? 

Looking for a bit of buzz but the place is dead?  

This idea is an app that tells you in real time how busy a bar / club is before you fork out the taxi fair to arrive disappointed. 

This idea sparked in a conversation with my cousin on a Sunday afternoon at my Granny’s house. When exchanging stories from the night before he was complaining about the line to get a drink because the bar he was at was so full. Meanwhile I was talking about how dead the club I was at was. Thats when I thought, if only there was a way of knowing what the place would be like, before you got there. 

I had thought about about live videos, check ins and using direct information from each bar - but they all seemed to be unsuitable, and possibly in breach of peoples privacy!

The technicalities behind this app would be inspired by googles real time data about how busy businesses are. Google collect periodic and anonymous location data from phones with location services turned on. I want to use this information and project it into an app that allows users to see how busy that bar is at that moment.  

I want the app to be based on bars and clubs in Belfast, but has potential to be created for any city.

## Pros

+ Saves money paying into a club / paying for a taxi to a place that isn’t what you expected.
+ Helpful for people visiting Belfast from different countries to see what clubs are open around them. 
+ The app can grow to include more cities.
+ Can be used as a platform for bars and clubs to advertise events / nights / promotions

## Cons

+ There will need to be thorough research about the exact functionality of the app and how accurate the information about each bar / club will be.
+ If the app was to use the idea of knowing from peoples location services, I face the issue that people might not have the services enabled. Meaning you could arrive to find a place you think is quiet, packed!
+ The app will have to be regularly updated if new bars open 


## How might it be built?

+ prototypes for this app using Invision / Adobe XD. 
+ design using sketch / illustrator / after effects. 
+ promotional video using after effects.
+ promotional website.
+ social media campaign.

## Who’s it for?

My target market for this idea is people that 

+ are over the age of 18  
+ regularly check their phones 
+ possibly not living in the city centre area
+ visiting Belfast on a holiday 

## What’s the business model?

The app will be free to download.

Bars and clubs could pay a sum of money to advertise nights / events / drinks promotions.

## Idea 2 - A language app for basic communication

## Overview

During my time abroad and with Spanish lessons at a language school I was throwing myself into getting caught up on grammar spelling and technical aspects of the language. 
Majority of apps i used would start with grammar and basic words of for example animals, colours etc. 
 
I want to create an app targeting specifically travellers and holiday goers that cannot commit to learning the whole language but want to be able to communicate the basics with confidence. 

The goals of the app will be to guide users through a series of phrases and questions that will be basics to get them by in a country. This will be aided by voice recordings of pronunciation. When the user has completed the guide all the information easy assessable in the app so they can go back to revise or use as reference at any time. 

A problem I had also was when someone would say a phrase or word I would remember that I had seen it before in an app but I couldn’t remember what it meant or easily go back to revisit it. 

I would like this to be an app, the idea behind this being that people can learn on the go, whether its the bus journey to work, in bed at night or even in the airport before to arrive at the country. I specifically want to focus on the fact that the library of phrases will be easily assessable, for those mind blank times in a restaurant trying to ask for the bill.

## Pros

+ Gives users the chance to learn basic phrases of a language to get them by when visiting a country.
+ Content will be stored on the app so users can access the information when offline

## Cons 

+ Because the nature of the app is simply to learn the basic phrases to get by, users will not gain an understanding of grammar or how to communicate further in the conversation.
+ There are already many language apps available so a lot of focus on the promotion stategy will be needed.
