# Aynsley Longridge : IXD507 Project Ideas

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Idea 1 - An app that tells you how busy bars are

## Overview

Looking for a quiet drink only to find there is a deadly que? 

Looking for a bit of buzz but the place is dead?  

This idea is an app that tells you in real time how busy a bar / club is before you fork out the taxi fair to arrive disappointed. 

This idea sparked in a conversation with my cousin on a Sunday afternoon at my Granny’s house. When exchanging stories from the night before he was complaining about the line to get a drink because the bar he was at was so full. Meanwhile I was talking about how dead the club I was at was. Thats when I thought, if only there was a way of knowing what the place would be like, before you got there. 

I had thought about about live videos, check ins and using direct information from each bar - but they all seemed to be unsuitable, and possibly in breach of peoples privacy!

The technicalities behind this app would be inspired by googles real time data about how busy businesses are. Google collect periodic and anonymous location data from phones with location services turned on. I want to use this information and project it into an app that allows users to see how busy that bar is at that moment.  

I want the app to be based on bars and clubs in Belfast, but has potential to be created for any city.

## Pros

+ Saves money paying into a club / paying for a taxi to a place that isn’t what you expected.
+ Helpful for people visiting Belfast from different countries to see what clubs are open around them. 
+ The app can grow to include more cities.
+ Can be used as a platform for bars and clubs to advertise events / nights / promotions

## Cons

+ There will need to be thorough research about the exact functionality of the app and how accurate the information about each bar / club will be.
+ If the app was to use the idea of knowing from peoples location services, I face the issue that people might not have the services enabled. Meaning you could arrive to find a place you think is quiet, packed!
+ The app will have to be regularly updated if new bars open 


## How might it be built?

+ prototypes for this app using Invision / Adobe XD. 
+ design using sketch / illustrator / after effects. 
+ promotional video using after effects.
+ promotional website.
+ social media campaign.

## Who’s it for?

My target market for this idea is people that 

+ are over the age of 18  
+ regularly check their phones 
+ possibly not living in the city centre area
+ visiting Belfast on a holiday 

## What’s the business model?

The app will be free to download.

Bars and clubs could pay a sum of money to advertise nights / events / drinks promotions.
